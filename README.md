# PhotoAppPractice

A simple application where photos can be added and deleted from the gallery or camera. It also allows marking the location where the photos were taken and viewing detailed information about them. Since it is an Expo project, you can run the code on a virtual phone emulator or the web version (e.g., [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)). When you run
```bash
expo start
```
in the terminal, the application will start running.
